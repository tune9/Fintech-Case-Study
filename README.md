## **Overview and Origin** 
Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum (a decentralized,open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality) co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. The company was built as an open-source blockchain that undergoes a rigorous peer-review process by scientists and programmers in academia. According to its website, Cardano’s native token coin, ADA, is the only coin with a “scientific philosophy and research-driven approach. The main purpose of this community of scientists, engineers and leaders is to unite in order to create a technology platform that will ignite the positive change the world needs. This is all made possible financially due to a built-in treasury system that gets a constant stream of funds from transaction fees and treasury taxes. The platform was designed with sustainability in mind in order to create a system that governs and also finances itself without being dependent on donations. However, according to Crunchbase, the company has raised a total of $62.2M in funding over 4 rounds beginning with their Initial Coin Offering in October of 2015 and the latest round in January of 2018.  

## **Purpose** 
Diving into the root of the problems Cardano is primarily attempting to solve - scaling and infrastructure. The company believes that ADA is the first third generation cryptocurrency with bitcoin being a first-generation cryptocurrency that introduced the idea of digital coins and ethereum, a second generation cryptocurrency that expanded the use cases for coins to smart contracts. Therefore Cardano’s goal is to solve the problems related to scalability, interoperability and sustainability on cryptocurrency platforms. 



### 1. Scalability 
Cardano uses an algorithm known as Ouroboros to solve the scalability problem common in most cryptocurrencies. Ouroboros utilizes a Proof of Stake (PoS) approach that helps save on energy costs and enables faster transaction processing. The blockchain streamlines the number of nodes in a network by appointing leaders responsible for verifying and validating transactions from a collection of nodes. The leader node pushes transactions to the main network. This prevents the use of an enormous amount of energy to secure its network. Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), mining farms do not need to be built to solve complex cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions. On the other hand, validators on a PoS system are rewarded by receiving the transaction fees associated with a transaction and are incentivized to correctly do this due to the amount they have staked. This is a financial motivator because the amount they have staked is higher than the sum of all the transaction fees. Cardano also uses RINA (Recursive Internetworked Architecture) to scale its network. This technology will help reduce the bandwidth which is required for communicating and disseminating data. According to Boxmining, the idea is that RINA has fewer protocols but is able to work faster, yet still providing transparency, privacy and scalability.


### 2. Interoperability
Interoperability refers to the portability of a cryptocurrency both within its natural ecosystem and in its interface with the existing global finance ecosystem. Essentially this allows cross-chain transactions between cryptocurrencies and seamless transactions with the global finance ecosystem. This is made possible through side chains, which conduct transactions between two parties off chain. According to Investopedia, Cardano is also exploring ways for institutions and individuals to selectively divulge metadata related to transactions and identities to enable use of cryptocurrencies for trading and daily transactions.



### 3. Sustainability
Lastly, sustainability is about governance structures that provide incentives to miners and other stakeholders and about evolving a self-sustaining economic model for cryptocurrency. Cardano aims to build a “constitution” of protocols to avoid messy hard forks, such as the ones that occurred in bitcoin and ethereum. A hard fork is a radical change to a network’s protocol that makes previously valid blocks and transactions invalid and requires all nodes and users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. 


### Solutions
Cardano has an ambitious plan that will cater to all sorts of customer base. It is available as a cryptocurrency via ADA as part of its settlement layer. Customers will be able to make payments, withdraw funds through ATMs and even send money to other people. The company also plans to move beyond the settlement layer to a Control later, which will serve as a trusted computation framework for sophisticated systems such as gambling and gaming systems. Other applications outlined on its website are identity management, a credit system, and Dadalus, a universal cryptocurrency wallet with automated crypto trading facility and crypto to fiat conversion capabilities. 


## **Results** 
Cardano has experienced sustained growth, technical innovation, community expansion and major partnerships in the recent year. These are all key metrics used to measure success in the cryptocurrency space. The addition of native tokens and the launch of smart contract capability increased the global adoption of Cardano. The growth will only continue as the company aims to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the blockchain. It is possible to measure this growth by looking at the number of native assets minted, the number of new wallets created and the number of on-chain transactions. According to CoinJournal, the Cardano ecosystem has seen over 2.5 million native assets minted since March 1, 2021, when the multi-asset ledger feature was added. There have been 2.58 million new wallets created and over 23.8 million on-chain transactions. According to recent data from Messari, aside from Bitcoin, Cardano 0is in the top place in terms of transaction activity, outpacing Ethereum as of February 17, 2022. The increase in transaction volume can be directly correlated to the fractional price users are paying in fees compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum users. The volume of transactions is projected to continue increasing as more users begin adopting the recently rolled out Alonzo Hard Fork that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on the blockchain. Cardano has also seen major partnerships that will be vital in creating value and utility within the ecosystem. Some of these key partnerships include e-sports platform Rival, fintech UBX, and non-profit Save the Children, an organization that targets the use of ADA for humanitarian projects in East Africa. Scantrust and Baia’s Wine, which are using the Cardano blockchain for supply chain traceability applications. 



## **Recommendations**
In terms of pure retail adoption, I would like to see Cardano become a bigger player in the Defi space and build its own NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) marketplace. Although it was reported by CoinJournal that over 2 million NFT minted so far, that number would grow significantly more if it created its own marketplace like its competitor Solana. With the highest mainstream adoption currently coming from NFTs combined with Cardano’s impressive transaction speeds and low fees, the growth will be massive.
